**Attendance**: This is a laboratory course so attendance is required.
If you cannot attend the lab session because of illness or emergency,
please **email before class**.  There are two required field trips for
this lab course.  One field trip takes place during regularly
scheduled lab time, but will be a late return. One **weekend field
trip (May 17)** is scheduled and **attendance to this trip is
mandatory**

**Grades**: The lab part of the course is worth 30% of your total grade.

|Assignment   | Percent     
|-------------|-------------
|Lab Worksheets/Practicals| 20%
|Lab Report               | 10%
|Species Reports          |  5%


**Lab reports: **You will all write a lab report for the Ocean
Acidification two part lab. The **draft lab report (Introduction and Methods) 
is due on April 21/22** (your lab day). You will go through a peer review 
process with reviewed papers due the next week (**reviews due April 28/29).**   
The reviews should include constructive comments on improving the report and
a “grade” (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, or Excellent). **The final lab
report is due on May 12/13**.  **All reports are due by midnight on the
due date and must be turned in via the class website**

**Worksheets: **In each lab period you will fill out a worksheet. This
worksheet is due at the end of the lab period.

**Species report: **Each student will choose an invertebrate species to
profile.  Species profiles will consist of a video production with information,
references, and pictures of the species in a creative way.  More details on 
the video will follow. **The species profile video is due on May
28/29.**  **Students will unveil their production during the FISH310 film festival (during lab May 28/29)**.
